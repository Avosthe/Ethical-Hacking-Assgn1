      </h2>

      <p>
        <span class="name">db</span> is a peer-to-peer broadcasting service, owned and funded by its listeners, DJ’s, and producers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Listeners subscribe to <span class="name">db</span> for €5/mo. In return, they receive full access to a DRM-free library of audio content, including radio panels, DJ sets, recorded lectures, commissioned audio works, and audiobooks, updated monthly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Content produced by <span class="name">db</span> will focus on topics of:
      </p>

      <ul class="list">
        <li>— Peer-to-peer networking and decentralisation</li>
        <li>— Economic independence for creative communities</li>
        <li>— Decentralised collaboration, both online and offline</li>
        <li>— Forkable community infrastucture</li>
        <li>— Unbranded spaces</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Each month, new content is commissioned by <span class="name">db</span>, inviting new voices onto the network to explore the above topics. A pool is created each month, using funds from listener subscriptions and donations to pay producers, DJs, and artists for their work.
      </p>

      <p>
        Any surplus funding from <span class="name">db</span>’s monthly pool can either be re-invested back into the network, or re-distributed back to subscribers and contributors (each subscriber and contributor chooses how their cut is delegated).
      </p>

      <p>
        To begin, <span class="name">db</span> will start with a minimum monthly pool of €500. As subscriber numbers grow, so too will the value of the pool, which is announced at the beginning of each month.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="name">db</span> will be built on top of a peer-to-peer network. Content will be distributed using file sharing protocols to the network’s subscribers. In order to promote decentralisation away from commercial platforms, we must start with our own efforts.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is an experiment into the funding of creative works using decentralised tooling. We want to demonstrate that creative independence online is possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        Opens soon.
